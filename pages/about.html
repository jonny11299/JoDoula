        <p>My name is Jo Bechtold (she/her) and I grew up outside Big Sky, Montana. I was raised in a tight-knit, rural community. My community relied on one another for survival. Though there were few financial opportunities, mutual care was a daily part of our lives and I loved being intertwined so deeply. Through our relationships with one another, all of our needs were met.</p>
        <p>Growing up in the mountains, my father instilled me a deep love and respect for nature. I feel most at home outside. I love swimming, hiking, and cross-country skiing.</p>
        <p>I am also an artist. This year, a dear friend taught me how to quilt because I wanted to feel connected to the women in my lineage who were experts. I also love to embroider, make candles, and write. In the next year, I hope to learn how to cook more Polish dishes to feel closer to my late grandmother. I live in South Seattle with my partner and perfect little dog. </p>
