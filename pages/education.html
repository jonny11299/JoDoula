        <p>For the last ten years, I've found time to spend time with children and their families. I supported myself in high school and college as a nanny, working with newborns all the way up to teenagers. I was also a live-in nanny during the Covid-19 pandemic and took care of a two week old baby and his three year old brother! In addition to working my day job, I spend my time as Children's Coordinator at Valley and Mountain, a progressive and affirming faith community in South Seattle. In this role, I am lucky enough to build meaningful relationships with children and their families and see them grow up.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In 2017, I moved from Montana to Seattle to pursue a degree in Social Work from Seattle University. Since graduating, I have gone on to earn my Master's in Social Work and build a career in Public Policy, working specifically to serve our unhoused neighbors and reform the Child Welfare System. My Social Work career has granted me the opportunity to work with all types of folks: young mothers experiencing homeless, incarcerated youth, older folks with dementia, and many many others! My Master's program was designed for students who wanted to go on and become a therapist. My background in mental health means I am well-equipped to support you in your emotional journey. Please note that I am not a licensed therapist.</p>

        <p>In 2025, I graduated from Bastry University's Post-Partum Doula Course.</p>
