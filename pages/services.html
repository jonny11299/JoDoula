          <p>Post-Partum Doulas provide emotional, information, and physical support for new families in the weeks after childbirth. It's such a gift to be invited into this tender new chapter of your life, and I promise to be non-judgemental and supportive. I want to support everyone in your family: mothers, fathers, any gendered parents, other children in the family, the new baby, and anyone else in your close circle! I love working with queer families, blended families, and all types of creative family webs. I'll help with this major life transition by supporting mental health journeys, facilitating learning about how to care for a newborn, and providing ample resources to empower caretakers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <h3>Here a few more examples of how we will share our time together:</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>Newborn care guidance: </strong>I provide support with breastfeeding, (if that's a part of your journey!) bottle feeding, soothing, and understanding baby cues. I can also help you swaddle and bathe your baby, alongside finding a carrier that is most comfortable for you.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>Emotional and physical support: </strong>I'll check in with you about how you're feeling and provide support and reassurance. Spending time exploring your mental well-being is an important part of our work together. We will also make sure you're well nourished, rested and your health is on the path to recovery. I love spending 1:1 time with newborns or other children in the house while new parents rest and recover. I will engage in some light meal prep, tidy and refresh your space, and help activate your support systems into caring for you and your family!</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>Resources and information: </strong>Providing evidence-based information will help you make informed decisions. We will connect you to any services, specialists, or research you need in fields such as lactation support, post-partum depression, and other parenting and caretaking groups.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If you need a type of support that isn't listed here, let's talk about it! </p>

          <p>A typical part-partum doula/family relationship lasts for the first three months after a baby is born. My ideal situation would be coming to your house <strong>two to three times a week for four hour shifts for twelve weeks.</strong> We can work together to find a rhythm that works best for us.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>If you would like to work together but have a limited income, please reach out.</strong> I can take a few no-cost and sliding scale income clients a year.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>I charge $55 per hour for my time.</strong></p>
