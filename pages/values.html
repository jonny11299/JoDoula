        <p>As a Doula, I lead with my heart and value relationships. My beliefs are influenced by intersectional feminists, anti-capitalists, and the Liberation Movement. I also believe in Health at Every Size and Harm-Reduction. I belong to a faith tradition rooted in Liberation Theology, which believes Spirit will always side with the oppressed, marginalized, and exploited. With my faith community, I participate in in community organizing actions and civil disobedience, protesting ICE, the genocide of Palestinians, and mistreatment of the LQBTQIA+ community.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I am a queer woman from a poor/working class background and would love to serve clients who share those identities, but am totally open to working with anyone from any walk of life.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><em>If there are values you hold and want to make sure we are on the same page about before working together, please let me know! Doula work is so intimate and vulnerable. It's important we feel comfortable and seen by one another.</em></p>
